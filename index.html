										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/laasya_senior_pic.png" alt="" /></span>I am a student at Rutgers University expecting to graduate in 2023. I plan to pursue a career in Computer Science. Apart from academics at Rutgers, I’m involved in an organization called WICS, Women in Computer Science, and attended different events such as the HackRU(Rutgers hackathon), HackHERS(WICS hackathon), Virtual Career Fairs, etc.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/laasya_dance_pic.JPG" alt="" /></span>I have previously attended Lawrence High School, where I have actively participated in clubs and other extracurricular activities. Some of my key involvements were National Honor Society, the Girls Varsity Tennis Team, STEM Academy, International Alliance Club, and Chemistry Club. In addition, outside of school, I was a mentor at Enspire Academy, a public speaking and leadership training facility.</p>
									<p>Apart from academics, I am very passionate about tennis, dance, and art.</p>
									<p>I’ve been playing tennis since 6th grade and was top 3 in the Varsity Girls Tennis Team in high school.</p>
									<p>I have been learning an Indian classical dance form for the past 8 years. Over the years, I have performed many times on stage and won several awards.</p>
									<p>I am also a talented artist and have been painting since 2nd grade and made over 50 paintings. My art has been showcased in the Mercer County Exhibition, Youth Art Month Exhibition, Congressional Art Competition, and was published in magazines. I also participated in multiple competitions as well. <a href="#art" target="blank" class="button small">see my artwork</a></p>
									<p>In my free time, I like to play badminton, volleyball and enjoy sketching and listening to music.</p>

											<h3>Recommendation by Vijayesh Sainju</h3>
											<h4>CTO for OpenMyNetwork</h4>
											<blockquote>"Laasya worked with Open My Network for over a year. She started by helping us with the UX for our site. She eventually managed our Mobile App Team. She is very hard working and managed to run meetings with our team in US and Asia at the same time. Eventually she worked on our EdTech based product called CODEE that helps empower guidance counselors. The CODEE system used RASA, DialogFlow, Python and various ML technologies.
												<br><br>
												She is extremely organized with her tasks and worked many times directly with the CEO and the CTO.
												I personally believe that she has the ability to handle all types of teams and work."</blockquote>
